This is my picom config.  I use [[https://github.com/pijulius/picom][pijulius' picom]] which has awesome animations!

There are 2 main files in this directory:
- [[./picom.conf][picom.conf]] - My picom config
- [[./picom.nix][picom.nix]] - A Nix module to import the pijulius fork of picom into my setup via the import block of my [[../../home.nix][home.nix]]
