#+title: User-level Nix Modules
#+author: Emmet

Separate Nix files can be imported as modules using an import block:
#+BEGIN_SRC nix
imports = [ import1.nix
            import2.nix
            ...
          ];
#+END_SRC

My user-level Nix modules are organized into this directory:
- [[./app][app]] - Apps or collections of apps bundled with my configs
  - [[./app/browser][browser]] - Used to set default browser
  - [[./app/dmenu-scripts][dmenu-scripts]]
  - [[./app/doom-emacs][doom-emacs]]
  - [[./app/flatpak][flatpak]] - Installs flatpak as a utility (flatpaks must be installed manually)
  - [[./app/games][games]] - Gaming setup
  - [[./app/git][git]]
  - [[./app/keepass][keepass]]
  - [[./app/ranger][ranger]]
  - [[./app/terminal][terminal]] - Configuration for terminal emulators
  - [[./app/virtualization][virtualization]] - Virtualization and compatability layers
- [[./lang][lang]] - Various bundled programming languages
  - I will probably get rid of this in favor of a shell.nix for every project, once I learn how that works
- [[./pkgs][pkgs]] - "Package builds" for packages not in the Nix repositories
  - [[./pkgs/pokemon-colorscripts.nix][pokemon-colorscripts]]
  - [[./pkgs/rogauracore.nix][rogauracore]] - not working yet
- [[./shell][shell]] - My default bash and zsh configs
  - [[./shell/sh.nix][sh]] - bash and zsh configs
  - [[./shell/cli-collection.nix][cli-collection]] - Curated useful CLI utilities
- [[./style][style]] - Stylix setup (system-wide base16 theme generation)
- [[./wm][wm]] - Window manager, compositor, wayland compositor, and/or desktop environment setups
  - [[./wm/hyprland][hyprland]]
  - [[./wm/xmonad][xmonad]]
  - [[./wm/picom][picom]]

** Variables imported from flake.nix
Variables can be imported from [[../flake.nix][flake.nix]] by setting the =extraSpecialArgs= block inside the flake (see [[../flake.nix][my flake]] for more details).  This allows variables to merely be managed in one place ([[../flake.nix][flake.nix]]) rather than having to manage them in multiple locations.

I use this to pass a few attribute sets:
- =userSettings= - Settings for the normal user (see [[../flake.nix][flake.nix]] for more details)
- =systemSettings= - Settings for the system (see [[../flake.nix][flake.nix]] for more details)
- =inputs= - Flake inputs (see [[../flake.nix][flake.nix]] for more details)
- =pkgs-stable= - Allows me to include stable versions of packages along with (my default) unstable versions of packages
- =pkgs-emacs= - Pinned version of nixpkgs I use for Emacs and its dependencies
- =pkgs-kdenlive= - Pinned version of nixpkgs I use for kdenlive
