#+title: System Profiles

This directory contains various system profiles which can easily be set in [[../flake.nix][my flake.nix]] by setting the =profile= variable. Each profile directory contains a =configuration.nix= for system-level configuration and a =home.nix= for user-level configuration. Setting the =profile= variable in [[../flake.nix][my flake]] will automatically source the correct =configuration.nix= and =home.nix=.

Current profiles I have available are:
- [[./personal][Personal]] - What I would run on a personal laptop/desktop*
- [[./work][Work]] - What I would run on my work laptop/desktop*
- [[./homelab][Homelab]] - What I would run on a server or homelab*
- [[./worklab][Worklab]] - My homelab config with my work SSH keys preinstalled*
- [[./wsl][WSL]] - Windows Subsystem for Emacs (uses [[https://github.com/nix-community/NixOS-WSL][NixOS-WSL]])
- [[./nix-on-droid][Nix on Droid]] - So that I can run Emacs on my phone (uses [[https://github.com/nix-community/nix-on-droid][nix-on-droid]])

*My [[./personal][personal]] and [[./work][work]] profiles are actually functionally identical (the [[./work][work]] profile is actually imported into the [[./personal][personal]] profile)! The only difference between them is that my [[./personal][personal]] profile has a few extra things like gaming and social apps.

*My [[./homelab][homelab]] and [[./worklab][worklab]] profiles are similarly functionally identical (they both utilize the this [[./homelab/base.nix][base.nix]] file)! The only difference is that they have different preinstalled ssh keys.
